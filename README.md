# 🌀 Nonlinear Dynamical Systems

## Overview

A **nonlinear dynamical system** is a mathematical model that describes how a system evolves over time according to **nonlinear** rules. Unlike linear systems, these models can produce rich and complex behavior, including:

- **Bifurcations** (sudden qualitative changes)
- **Limit cycles** (self-sustained oscillations)
- **Chaos** (sensitive dependence on initial conditions)

Such systems are governed by nonlinear differential or difference equations and cannot be solved using superposition or straightforward analytical methods.

## Applications

Nonlinear dynamical systems appear across many scientific domains:

- 🔥 Environmental modeling: *Forest fire dynamics and spread models*
- 🌪️ Atmospheric science: *Lorenz attractor*
- 🧠 Neuroscience: *Neural oscillators and circuits*
- 🌱 Ecology: *Predator-prey interactions*
- ⚙️ Engineering: *Nonlinear control systems*
- 📈 Economics: *Market and population dynamics*

## Tools and Analysis

Studying these systems often involves:
- **Phase space analysis**
- **Fixed point stability**
- **Numerical integration**
- **Lyapunov exponents** and **bifurcation diagrams**

These tools help reveal long-term behavior, stability, and transitions in system dynamics.
